                The telecom industry is an essential part of our day-to-day
                life, reaching billions of people at the same time, no matter
                the weather, geographical location or nationality. It is a vital
                resource, and an outage would have a direct and potentially
                catastrophic impact on society, the economy and the functioning
                of Government. Telecoms need to be protected and controlled, as
                each asset inside data centres, base stations, poles, or any
                other site, is critical for business continuity. A service
                interruption can have a serious impact on both business and
                residential customers and might incur penalties, which would be
                very costly and also damage a supplierâ€™s reputation.
