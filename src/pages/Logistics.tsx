                Transportation is vital to critical infrastructure and many
                major corporations, to keep the wheels of the global economy
                turning. Any break or interruption to this service caused by
                internal and external theft in the supply chain can cause a
                costly loss of revenue, a breach in health and safety, customer
                dissatisfaction and a ruined reputation. Containers need to
                remain unopened during transport to secure the goods against
                contamination, plus the large number of vehicles in the
                logistics industry means there are many vehicles and areas that
                need to be secured, but also accessible at all times, day and
                night. Ensuring security in the transportation and logistics
                sector is especially challenging, as the landscape is changing
                at the same pace as technological developments advance.
